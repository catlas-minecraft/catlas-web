# Catlas Editor

An iD-style world editor for Catlas game maps. The editor works in the XZ plane,
keeps Y as an inspected property, and synchronizes entities through the Catlas API.
Each map tile covers `512 x 512` world cells. At the initial zoom level, one cell is
rendered as one CSS pixel, matching the native `512 x 512` tile image.

## Architecture

The implementation is split into the same layers that make an interactive map
editor manageable:

1. `Graph` is the immutable entity store for nodes and ways.
2. `History` records annotated graph transitions and provides undo/redo.
3. `Actions` are small graph transformations such as moving a node or changing tags.
4. `Modes` and pointer behaviors decide how input becomes actions.
5. `Operations` expose user commands with availability, disabled reasons, and `execute()`.
6. `Presets` define game feature types, default tags, geometry, and snap policies.
7. `Validation` reports structural issues before upload.
8. `Renderer` draws areas, lines, nodes, midpoints, and active drawing state with D3/SVG.
9. `Sync` loads viewport entities and uploads changesets through an Effect service.
10. React renders the toolbar, inspector, validation state, and save controls around the editor.

## Authentication

Editing is available without a session, but publishing requires a verified Catlas API session.
The toolbar's developer sign-in creates a JWT from a user id through `POST /auth/sessions`.
The token is stored in `sessionStorage`, verified on startup and immediately before publishing,
and attached to write requests as `Authorization: Bearer <session-jwt>`. Signing out revokes the
session when the API is reachable and always removes the local credential.

Relations are deliberately outside the current editing surface. The graph and API
boundaries leave room for them without mixing relation behavior into the first
point/line/area milestone.

## Public Editor API

`CatlasEditor` owns the mutable session and exposes snapshots through
`getSnapshot()` and `subscribe()`. UI commands use methods such as `setMode()`,
`undo()`, `redo()`, `applyPreset()`, and `save()`. Commands that need availability
metadata are obtained with `operation(id)`.

## Development

```sh
vp install
vp dev
vp check
vp test
vp build
```

The default development setup proxies `/api` to the Catlas API and `/tiles` to the
tile service. Editing remains local when either service is unavailable, so a failed
load or publish does not discard the current history.
